# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Movie-Reviews

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a collection of text samples using machine learning and natural language processing techniques.
The dataset used for this analysis consists of two separate files, one containing 1000 positive text samples, and the other containing 1000 negative text samples.

Python is used for the analysis, along with popular libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and NLTK. The project preprocesses the text data,
extracts relevant features, and trains a machine learning model using the Scikit-Learn library.

The trained model is then used to predict the sentiment of new text samples with high accuracy.

The project provides a PyCharm project that details the process of data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

This project is an excellent resource for those interested in natural language processing and machine learning, specifically sentiment analysis.
